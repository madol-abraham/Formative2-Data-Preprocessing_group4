# Formative-2---Data-Preprocessing_group4

## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, we were tasked to work with two real-world datasets that contained overlapping but different features. Our goal was to augment, merge, and enhance the data while ensuring consistency in a machine learning pipeline.

This assignment assessed our ability to:

- Handle missing values in merged datasets.
- Merge datasets with transitive properties across features.
- Engineer new features from existing data.
- Apply CSV augmentation techniques to improve dataset quality.
- Ensure data consistency for machine learning models.
## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python packages (see below)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone this repository or download the `Formative2_Group4.ipynb` file.
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If a requirements.txt file is not provided, install the essential libraries manually:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
Open Formative2_Group4.ipynb in the Jupyter interface.

## Usage Guide

### Follow these steps to execute the notebook:

1. Load Dependencies: Run the first few cells to import necessary libraries.

2. Data Preprocessing: The notebook includes data argumentation on csv file, merging datasets with transitive properties, Data Consistency and Quality Checks. Modify if necessary.

3. Model Training:
