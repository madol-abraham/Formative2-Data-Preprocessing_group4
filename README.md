# Formative-2-Data-Preprocessing_group4

## Assignment Overview

For this assignment, we were tasked with working with two real-world datasets that contained overlapping but different features. We aimed to augment, merge, and enhance the data while ensuring consistency in a machine learning pipeline.

This assignment assessed our ability to:

- Handle missing values in merged datasets.
- Merge datasets with transitive properties across features.
- Engineer new features from existing data.
- Apply CSV augmentation techniques to improve dataset quality.
- Ensure data consistency for machine learning models.
## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Required Python packages (see below)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone this repository or download the `Formative2_Group4.ipynb` file.
2. Open file via Google Colab.
3. Install dependencies:
 install the essential libraries manually:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
Open Formative2_Group4.ipynb in Google Colab.

## Usage Guide

### Follow these steps to execute the notebook:

1. Load Dependencies: Run the first few cells to import necessary libraries.

2. Data Preprocessing: The notebook includes data argumentation on the CSV file, merging datasets with transitive properties, Data Consistency and Quality Checks. Modify if necessary.

3. Model Training: 

## Video Walkthrough
Task 1. Data Augmentation on CSV Files was done by Nina and presented by her.
Task 2. Merging Datasets with Transitive Properties was done by Madol and presented by him.
Task 3. Data Consistency and Quality Checks were performed by Alhassan, and he covers it in the video.
Task 4. Bonus Challenge, this was taken up by Florent, and he presents on the same.
