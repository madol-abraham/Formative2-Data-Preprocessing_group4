# Formative-2---Data-Preprocessing_group4

## Project Overview

This project is part of an assignment for Group 4, focusing on implementing machine learning techniques using Python. The notebook, `Formative2_Group4.ipynb`, contains data analysis, model training, and evaluation steps. The objective is to explore a given dataset, apply appropriate preprocessing techniques, and train models to derive meaningful insights.
